  const definitionDetails: Record<string, { explanation: string; example: string }> = {
    'Compound Interest': {
      explanation: 'Compound interest is when you earn interest not just on your initial investment, but also on the interest you\'ve already earned. This creates exponential growth over time, often called the "snowball effect".',
      example: 'If you invest £1,000 at 10% annually: Year 1 = £1,100, Year 2 = £1,210 (not £1,200), Year 10 = £2,594. The extra £94 in year 10 comes from compounding.',
    },
    'CAGR': {
      explanation: 'CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) smooths out year-to-year volatility to show the average rate at which an investment grows annually. It\'s more accurate than simple averages for long-term returns.',
      example: 'If an investment goes from £1,000 to £2,000 in 5 years, the CAGR is 14.87%, not 20% (which would be the simple average).',
    },
    'Diversification': {
      explanation: 'Diversification means not putting all your eggs in one basket. By spreading investments across different companies, sectors, and asset types, you reduce the risk that one poor performer will hurt your entire portfolio.',
      example: 'If you invest £1,000 across 5 sectors and one drops 50%, you only lose £100 total. If all £1,000 was in that one sector, you\'d lose £500.',
    },
    'Portfolio': {
      explanation: 'A portfolio is your complete collection of investments. It can include stocks, bonds, ETFs, mutual funds, and other assets. A well-balanced portfolio matches your risk tolerance and financial goals.',
      example: 'A moderate portfolio might be: 60% stocks (growth), 30% bonds (stability), 10% cash (liquidity).',
    },
    'Risk Tolerance': {
      explanation: 'Risk tolerance is your psychological and financial ability to handle investment losses without panicking. It depends on your age, income stability, financial goals, and personality. Higher risk tolerance allows for more aggressive (growth-focused) investments.',
      example: 'Conservative investor: Loses sleep over 5% drops, prefers bonds. Aggressive investor: Comfortable with 20% swings, invests heavily in stocks.',
    },
    'Asset Allocation': {
      explanation: 'Asset allocation is the strategy of dividing your portfolio among different asset categories (stocks, bonds, cash, real estate, etc.). It\'s the most important factor affecting portfolio risk and return. Your allocation should match your goals and timeline.',
      example: 'Young investor (30+ years to retirement): 80% stocks, 15% bonds, 5% cash. Near retiree: 40% stocks, 50% bonds, 10% cash.',
    },
    'ETF': {
      explanation: 'An Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) holds many stocks or bonds in one package, trading on exchanges like individual stocks. ETFs offer instant diversification, low fees, and flexibility. They\'re ideal for beginners wanting broad market exposure.',
      example: 'Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VUSA) holds all 500 companies in the S&P 500. Buying one share gives you tiny pieces of Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and 497 others.',
    },
    'Dividend': {
      explanation: 'A dividend is a cash payment companies make to shareholders from profits. Dividend-paying stocks provide regular income plus potential growth. Reinvesting dividends accelerates compounding. Dividend yield = annual dividend ÷ stock price.',
      example: 'If a £100 stock pays £4/year in dividends, the yield is 4%. Owning 100 shares = £400/year passive income. Reinvested over 20 years, this dramatically boosts returns.',
    },
    'Bull vs Bear Market': {
      explanation: 'Bull markets are prolonged periods of rising prices (typically 20%+ gains), driven by optimism and economic growth. Bear markets are extended declines (20%+ drops), triggered by pessimism or recession. Both are normal cycles.',
      example: 'Bull: 2009-2020 (stocks tripled after financial crisis). Bear: 2022 (stocks fell 25% due to inflation fears). Long-term investors buy during bears, hold through bulls.',
    },
    'Index Fund': {
      explanation: 'An index fund passively tracks a market index (like FTSE 100 or S&P 500) by holding the same stocks in the same proportions. They offer instant diversification, minimal fees, and historically beat 90% of actively managed funds over 15+ years.',
      example: 'Instead of picking individual stocks, invest £1,000 in a FTSE 100 index fund. You own pieces of the UK\'s 100 largest companies automatically rebalanced.',
