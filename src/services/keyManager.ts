/**
 * Key Manager - Secure key storage for app encryption
 *
 * This module centralises generation and retrieval of the app-wide AES-256
 * encryption key. The key itself is stored in the platform-provided secure
 * keystore/keychain via `expo-secure-store`. Large data (images, DB fields)
 * are encrypted with this key by other helpers; the key is never exported in
 * plaintext except within the running process.
 *
 * Exports:
 * - getOrCreateKey(): Promise<string>  — returns a base64-encoded 32-byte key
 * - clearKey(): Promise<void>           — delete the stored key from keystore
 */
